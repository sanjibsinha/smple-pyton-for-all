Okay, let's talk about *Control Flow* in Python.  This is a fundamental concept that allows your programs to make decisions and repeat actions.  Think of it as the "brain" of your code, determining the order in which things happen.

**1. Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)**

Conditional statements let you execute code blocks only if certain conditions are met.

```python
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")  # This will execute
elif age >= 13:  # "else if" - checks another condition if the first is false
    print("You are a teenager.")
else:
    print("You are a child.")

# Another example:
x = 10
y = 5

if x > y:
    print("x is greater than y")
elif x == y:
  print("x is equal to y")
else:
    print("x is less than y")


```

*   `if`: Checks a condition. If it's `True`, the code block below it executes.
*   `elif`:  (Short for "else if") Checks another condition *only* if the previous `if` or `elif` conditions were `False`. You can have multiple `elif` blocks.
*   `else`:  Executes a code block if *none* of the preceding `if` or `elif` conditions were `True`.
